# Globe traveler
The project is inspired on the idea to make a website where everyone who is  
interested in traveling can have the opportunity to share his/her experience.
This project is the third part of the milestone project. The system database is made in MongoDB. For the making of the functions it has been programing in Pyhton. The main focus was on the "crud" fucntions, making the project available to create,read,update and delete data by the users who must register to be able to use the system. The porject has been deploy in Heroku. The technologies used for the making of this project are in this readme file later on.

 The main goal of this project is to be able to share with other your traveling experiences, where you have been, what you did and if you would recommend the place you've been to anybody else who shares the same interest as you.

# __UX__

+ ### Design
* _Color Scheme_
    * The main color of the website is grey and white for the pages.
    * Red and blue are for input, edit and delete buttons.
    * Cyan is the color for the login and reg user buttons
    * White with dark text shadow is for the navbar titles and footer texts.
    * The rest of the text are in light-blue and black color.
    
* Typography
    * The **Dancing Script, cursive** is a lively casual script where the letters bounce and change size slightly. Caps are big, and goes below the baseline.
    Dancing Script references popular scripts typefaces from the 50's.
    It relates to Murray Hill (Emil Klumpp. 1956) in his weight distribution, and to Mistral (Roger Excoffon. 1953) in his lively bouncing effect.
    This type of typography suits at it best in friendly, spontaneous and informal look.

    * The **Raleway** is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

    * **Sans serif** it is usually used for titles that seek to make an impact, for headlines that must be read from a distance or for reading bodies that are relatively short.
    
* Imagery
    * Imagery is used most for the carousel of the website. The images are the face of this site and reflect at an early stage the purpose of this site. The images are inspired in different cities around the world, each one representing a continent. 
    * For now the images are only availbale in the carousel, but in a near future the purpose is to be able to store pictures in tyhe database that every register user might be able to load up.
