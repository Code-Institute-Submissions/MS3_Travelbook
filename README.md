# Globe traveler
The project is inspired on the idea to make a website where everyone who is  
interested in traveling can have the opportunity to share his/her experience.
This project is the third part of the milestone project. The system database is made in MongoDB. For the making of the functions it has been programing in Pyhton. The main focus was on the "crud" fucntions, making the project available to create,read,update and delete data by the users who must register to be able to use the system. The porject has been deploy in Heroku. The technologies used for the making of this project are in this readme file later on.

 The main goal of this project is to be able to share with other your traveling experiences, where you have been, what you did and if you would recommend the place you've been to anybody else who shares the same interest as you.

# __UX__

+ ### Design
* _Color Scheme_
    * The main color of the website is grey and white for the pages.
    * Red and blue are for input, edit and delete buttons.
    * Cyan is the color for the login and reg user buttons
    * White with dark text shadow is for the navbar titles and footer texts.
    
* Typography
    * The **Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif** font is the main font used throughout the game.
    * As a typeface, Arial is one of the most used designs in recent times thanks to the fact that it has specific characteristics that make it more accessible and it has become a basic element for textual content.
    Arial typeface is easy to read in a variety of sizes and in a variety of applications, not only on screen but also in print.
    * The **Helvetica** family is characterized by its neutrality, versatility and high readability. It is a very suitable typeface for informational posters.
    * **Sans serif** it is usually used for titles that seek to make an impact, for headlines that must be read from a distance or for reading bodies that are relatively short.
    
* Imagery
    * Imagery is the face of the game. Though the background its just a color. The main goal of the game are the images used. The images are inspired in the covid-19 advises, and work as a reminder of what we must do nowadays to stay safe. 
    * The reason why the game do not have a background image and just color is to make it more easier for the user to concentrate on the game cards.
